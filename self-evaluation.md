# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
- This type of looping is different from what im used to, but it's fun to see different ways of looping through arrays
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- The struggle felt very productive. The workflow is not yet completely streamlined. I still slow down in trying to process what to do next. However I do feel like it's speeding up with each exercise. Im slowly gaining confidence in my workflow
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I want to be very comfortable with the terminal commands. More practice with the workflow. No adjustments needed.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- None currently.
